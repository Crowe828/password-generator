# Password Generator

This is application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's primary function is to generate a new password for a user, based on their answers to a few simple prompts. The user must first specify the length of their password, and then whether or not they want lowercase, uppercase, numbers, or special characters in their password. After the user has correctly clicked through all of the prompts, a new password will be generated.
